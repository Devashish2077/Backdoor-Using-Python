# Backdoor Using Python

## For Server.py ->
[*] Keep server.py file in your host/listening machine (Ex. Linux)
    This will act as an listener for incoming connection from the targer machine
[*] Open server.py using any text editor    
[*] Specify your Host Machine's IP address and Port number (ex. 5555) in the [ sock.bind(('#host ip', #port)) ] section of the code
